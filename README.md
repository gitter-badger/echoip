echoip
======

A simple script to get your public address from (ipecho.net)[http://ipecho.net/], and your gateway address from netstat.

To install, simply run `./install` in the terminal. This copies the script to `/usr/local/bin`, which is assumed to be in `$PATH`. To uninstall, you can either run `./uninstall` or `rm /usr/local/bin/echoip`.
